//Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

//Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.
In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.
