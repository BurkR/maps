3. In the readme.md, reflect on your design process - How did you determine the current web map style? 
What specific topic motivate you to design the map? For example, you can design a map driven by the idea of Beaver Nation, the primary colors should be Orange and Black. (10 POINTS) At last, if you want to share you map to mapbox gallery, please Tweet it with #BuiltWithMapbox to submit it to the gallery.

The inspiration for this basemap was to depict the natural topography and the plant communities. The motivating factor for this design is my thesis topic, combining plants, archaeology, Native American uses of plants, where the plants occur, and preservation of cultural landscapes. 
The inspiration from the original basemap came from 'Cali Terrain Map by Amy Lee Walton

The colors are from coolors.co. for the Oregon State University theme colors and reference in the css folder. 


####Optional Task, I used the Google Maps to do this part. 

If you design a map representing a LGBT üåà topic or a Valentine's Day ‚ù§Ô∏è topic, you will receive the addtional points (5 POINTS). Think out aloud, what color ramp is appropriate for a LGBT theme? Like a rainbow color flag ?
