Lab 4: Basemap Design

https://burkr.github.io/maps/basemap4/index.html and 

https://burkr.github.io/maps/basemap4/README 


A base map design embodying an idea, such as Christmas map, St. Patrick Map, Beaver Nation, refugee camp, etc.

Check mapbox gallery to learn from other web cartographers' work. Since the use of color is a major task for a web map, you can get a color theme (a series of color are included) using the methods I mentioned below,

using a keyword. (refer to http://palettr.com);
using a picture. (refer to https://coolors.co);
color blindness. (refer to https://coolors.co); or
a high contrast color theme (refer to http://colorpalettes.net).

Once you made the base map using mapbox, please use a leaflet web page to call this map.
In the readme.md, please add a link (the link should be in the format of http://[github_username].github.io/[submissio_lab_04]) to access the web page of the mapbox basemap. This web page to access the base map should be the index.html of this github repository. Basically, By clicking on the link, the base map hosted by this github repository will show. Refer to lecture 13 to see a tutorial. (30 POINTS)

3. In the readme.md, reflect on your design process - How did you determine the current web map style? What specific topic motivate you to design the map? For example, you can design a map driven by the idea of Beaver Nation, the primary colors should be Orange and Black. (10 POINTS) At last, if you want to share you map to mapbox gallery, please Tweet it with #BuiltWithMapbox to submit it to the gallery.

####Optional Task

If you design a map representing a LGBT üåà topic or a Valentine's Day ‚ù§Ô∏è topic, you will receive the addtional points (5 POINTS). Think out aloud, what color ramp is appropriate for a LGBT theme? Like a rainbow color flag ?

Once you complete this lab assignment, please make sure both the github repository and the web site work appropriately. Then, you will need to submit the url of the GitHub repository to Canvas Dropbox. (On the assignment tab, press the Submit Assignment button to submit. Please contact the instructor or TA if you have any difficulty.)
